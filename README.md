<h1>MediTone</h1>

MediTone is a healthcare application designed to assist users with medication reminders and emergency alerts. The application provides personalized medication schedules and sends timely notifications via call and message to remind users to take their medications. In case of emergencies, users can quickly alert their doctors through the emergency feature.


## Features

- Patient Registration: As a doctor, you can easily add new patients to the MediTone app by registering their details, including name, age, gender, and contact information.

- Medication Reminders: Input medication details for each patient, such as medication name, dosage, and frequency. MediTone will then send automated call and message reminders to patients at scheduled times for medication 
  intake. Patients will receive a voice message stating, "It's time to take your medication."

- Emergency Alerts: Patients can use the "Emergency" feature in the app to trigger an alert, notifying the doctor well in advance of their arrival at the hospital. This allows doctors to arrange necessary medical 
  assistance promptly. When a patient submits an emergency form, the doctor will receive a call and hear a voice message stating, "There is a patient who needs immediate attention. Please be there."

## Usage

As a doctor, when a patient comes to my hospital, I will add them to the MediTone app and schedule all medication reminders based on their prescriptions. Patients will receive automated calls and messages at the appropriate times for medication intake. 

In the future, if a patient faces a serious situation, they can use the app's "Emergency" feature to send an alert to me while coming to the hospital. This way, I can be well-prepared to provide timely assistance and make necessary arrangements.
